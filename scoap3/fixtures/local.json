Interestingly, the latter turns out to be one of the auxiliary fermions, which becomes dynamical in the supersymmetry breaking vacuum. In all cases we are considering here, there is no sgoldstino mode and thus the goldstino does not have a superpartner.

In this work, we apply the procedure developed for fields in cosmological settings to analyze the quantization of a scalar field in the presence of an external electromagnetic classical field in a flat background. We find a natural Fock representation that admits a unitary implementation of the quantum field dynamics. It automatically allows to define a particle number density at all times in the evolution with the correct asymptotic behavior, when the electric field vanishes.

Searches for dark matter in the form of axions are proposed or underway across a range of experimental collaborations. As we look to the next generation of detectors, a natural question to ask is whether there are new experimental designs waiting to be discovered and how we might find them. Here we take a new approach to the experimental design procedure by using gradient descent techniques to search for optimal detector designs. We provide a proof of principle for this technique by searching 1D detectors varying the bulk properties of the detector until the optimal detector design is obtained. Remarkably, we find the detector is capable of outperforming a human designed experiment on which the search was initiated. This opens the door to further gradient descent searches of more complex 2D and 3D designs across a wider variety of materials and boundary geometries of the detector. There is also an opportunity to use more sophisticated gradient descent algorithms to complete a more exhaustive scan of the landscape of designs.","_created_at":"2022-06-27T10:50:48.179Z","_updated_at":"2023-10-02T15:40:24.634Z","related_licenses":[1],"related_materials":[]}},{"model":"articles.article","pk":64428,"fields":{"reception_date":null,"acceptance_date":null,"publication_date":"2022-04-19","first_online_date":null,"title":"Geometric phases distinguish entangled states in wormhole quantum mechanics","subtitle":"","abstract":"We establish a relation between entanglement in simple quantum mechanical qubit systems and in wormhole physics as considered in the context of the <math><mrow><mi>AdS</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>CFT</mi></mrow></math> correspondence.
